# Welcome to UnnyNet

UnnyNet is an important extension for social and realtime games and apps.

With UnnyNet you can power-up your game with real-time chat, friends, leaderboards and other social features. We offer out-of-the-box solution for client and server, which you can integrate in just 10 minutes.

UnnyNet helps you to build a community of your most engaged, active and loyal players right inside your game!

Our servers are designed to run at massive scale, and scale automatically with your user base. We have your back, so we expect from you to focus on the game itself and make it awesome.


###[Out-of-the-box](/basic/basic)

Integration of UnnyNet is extremely easy and takes not longer than 10 minutes. Instead of wasting your time on implementing features which any game already has, focus your energy on creating the best game!

###[Real-time Chat](/advanced/chat)

Realtime chat makes it easy to power a live community. Users can chat with each other 1-on-1 and in chat channels you create. Messages can contain images, emojis, links, and other content.

###[Leaderboards](/advanced/leaderboards)

Leaderboards are a great way to add a social and competitive element to any game. They're a fun way to drive competition among your players.

###[Achievements](/advanced/achievements)

Achievements can be a great way to increase your users' engagement within your game. You can implement achievements in your game to encourage players to experiment with features they might not normally use, or to approach your game with entirely different play styles. Achievements can also be a fun way for players to compare their progress with each other and engage in light-hearted competition.

###[Guilds](/advanced/guilds/guilds)

Players can also join long-term groups called guilds. Guilds, also known as clans, kinships or crews, are usually groups of people who are working toward a common goal in a game. A guild might emphasize raiding (progression through difficult dungeons with large groups of players) or it might focus on helping lower-level players acquire gear and experience.

### Friends

Friends are a great way to build a social community. Users can add other users to their list of friends, see who is online or when they were last online, chat together in realtime, and interact together in gameplay or collaboration.
