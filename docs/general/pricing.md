Basic features of UnnyNet will always be **FREE** for developers and players. Our ultimate goal is to put UnnyNet into all the games.

Additional features, like Game Analytics, Push Notifications, Real-time text translation and Payments might be paid. However all those features will be optional, so you are free to use any other services for those purposes.

We position UnnyNet as a huge community for game developers and players. Our main source of monetization will be based on optional features, mentioned above. Additionally we are going to offer all the players to purchase different stickers and emojis to use in the chat. Developers are welcome to participate and offer their stickers.  We like to think about UnnyNet as the next generation of Forums.
