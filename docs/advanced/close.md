# Close UnnyNet Window

Depending on a game, you might need to close UnnyNet window to display your in-game information. For example, if someone challenges you to the duel or invites you to play together.

```csharp fct_label="Unity"
UnnyNet.UnnyNetBase.CloseUnnyNet();
```

```java fct_label="Java"
unnynet.close();
```
