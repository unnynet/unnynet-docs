# Deploy

Whenever you change a Template or a Document in DE, it's saved on our servers, but not yet available for your end users. You can compare all the changes you make in DE with commits in GIT, with only difference that other DE users can see your commits. 

When you are ready to publish (like Push in git) your changes for the end users, you need open **Deploy** section in DE and click on **Deploy** button.
The process takes several seconds, and once it's completed, you can launch your game in Unity and get all the updated data.

Bear in mind that your are pushing only for the active Environment. If you want to push the changes to the Stage or Production environments, please use [Environment](/data_editor/advanced/environment) page for Data Migration.
