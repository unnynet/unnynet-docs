# Theme Customization

Every developer wants the chat, leaderboards and other features we provide feel and look like a part of the game.
We truly understand and support it. That's why we have a theme customization, which you can already use.

You can change fonts and colors for each element. This is just a start and we'll be improving this feature giving you more flexibility.
