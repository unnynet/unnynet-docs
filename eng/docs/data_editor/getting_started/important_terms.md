# Important terms:

1.  [**Template**](/data_editor/getting_started/templates) describes the structure and behaviour of your game object (item, monster, construction,...). As a programmer you can think of it as a **Class**. Template has to have a unique name and may contains a set of parameters.
2.  [**Parameter**](/data_editor/getting_started/parameters) describes a part of a Document, storing some value. Each parameter has a name and a type. Type can be simple like string, int, float, bool or a reference to any other Template. As a programmer you can think of parameter as a **Field** or **Property** of the **Class**.
3.  [**Document**](/data_editor/getting_started/documents) is a unique instance of a Template (Specific Item: Hunter's Bow, Gold Bar,...), which has it's own parameter values. Think of it as an **instance** of a **Class** as a programmer.
4.  [**Component**](/data_editor/getting_started/documents) is a simple Template, which doesn't have it's own Documents and can exists only inside of another Document. 
4.  [**Enum**](/data_editor/getting_started/enums) is enumerated type, which you can create and use in Data Editor.
