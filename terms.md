## 4. GDPR Terms

The terms of this Section 4 (the “GDPR Terms”) apply to the extent your Game Data includes information related to an identified or identifiable natural person that is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). Lower case terms used but not defined in this Addendum such as “personal data,” “personal data breach,” “processing,” “controller,” “processor,” “subprocessor” and “data subject” will have the same meaning as set forth in Article 4 of the GDPR. These GDPR Terms do not apply where Balancy is a controller of the personal data of its customers.

4.1. **Compliance with the GDPR and Processing of Personal Data.** You and Balancy agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the GDPR. You agree Balancy is the controller of all personal data.

Balancy’s security measures will be set forth in a Balancy Security Policy.

You are responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures for the Balancy Services meets your requirements. You acknowledge and agree that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing personal data as well as the risks to individuals) the security practices and policies implemented and maintained by Balancy provide a level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to your personal data. You are responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that you provide or control.

4.3. **Personal Data Breach.** Balancy shall notify you without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. Such notification will include that information a processor must provide to a controller under Article 33(3) to the extent such information is reasonably available to Balancy.

## 5. Fees for Use of the Balancy Services

5.1. Subject to the Terms, you may sign up for the Balancy Essentials Tier Services, which Balancy will provide to you without charge up to certain limits. Balancy may offer you the ability to use additional resources and services without charge for a trial period. Usage of resources and services beyond the trial period, usage of the Balancy Essentials Tier Services over the designated limits, or the use of other resources or services offered on the Website will require your purchase of additional resources or services via individually priced services or an appropriate paid Tier plan. The Balancy Essentials Tier Services limits, and the pricing for additional resources and services, can be found on the Website at [https://en.docs.balancy.dev/pricing/](https://en.docs.balancy.dev/pricing/) (or such other URL as Balancy may provide).

5.2. Payments for all purchased resources and services are due and must be made according to the pricing and related terms in the services description published in the Website. Unless otherwise noted in the service description, all fees will be billed in advance on a monthly basis (or at the interval indicated in Balancy’s fees and payment policies, if different) and are due at the time of invoice. You must provide Balancy with a credit card, and Balancy will automatically charge your credit card based on the paid Tier plan and any individually priced services you have selected on the due date unless you have raised a good faith objection prior to the due date. At Balancy’s sole discretion, Balancy may also agree with you to accept your payments via wire transfer, automated clearinghouse or PayPal. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Balancy’s measurements of your use of the Balancy Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Balancy and only in the form of credit for the Balancy Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Balancy to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and other billing and payment information that you provide to Balancy may be shared by Balancy with companies who work on Balancy’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Balancy and servicing your account.

5.3. Balancy may change its fees and payment policies for the Balancy Services at any time, but in the event of a fee increase, Balancy will honor the previous pricing policy for you for at least thirty (30) days after notifying you of the fee increase. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the Website (or such other URL as Balancy may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

5.4. You may not develop multiple Games to simulate or act as a single Game, develop Games under multiple unlinked accounts, or otherwise access the Balancy Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

5.5. The Balancy Essentials Tier Service is provided on an as-is basis and is intended for lightweight, low-volume usage of the Balancy Services. The Balancy Essentials Tier Service does not provide access to the full set of Balancy features, resources and services. Balancy does not provide any service level agreements or developer support for the Balancy Essentials Tier Service, other than Balancy's forum discussions. Permissible uses of the Balancy Essentials Tier Service include the development and launch of games by independent game studios and trial/evaluation usage by professional game studios and publishers. You will not be permitted to use the Balancy Essentials Tier Service for any Game if any of your other Games, or any Games of any of your Affiliates, are serviced by Balancy under a paid Tier plan, without Balancy’s express permission. If your Games misuse the Balancy Essential Tier Services, requiring intervention from Balancy, Balancy will work with you to quarantine the Game(s) to a high-risk server instance, address the misuse and/or to migrate your Games to an appropriate paid Tier plan for enhanced support. Notwithstanding the above, Balancy reserves the right to terminate your use of the Balancy Essentials Tier Service at any time for any reason.

5.6. Prices are exclusive of any taxes unless otherwise specified on the invoice as tax inclusive. You must pay any applicable value added, goods and services, sales, gross receipts, or other transaction taxes, fees, charges or surcharges, or any regulatory cost recovery surcharges or similar amounts that are owed under this agreement and which we are permitted to collect from you under applicable law. You will be responsible for any applicable stamp taxes and for all other taxes that you are legally obligated to pay. We will be responsible for all taxes based on our net income, gross receipts taxes imposed in lieu of taxes on income or profits, or taxes on our property ownership. If any taxes are required to be withheld on payments you make to us, you may deduct such taxes from the amount owed to us and pay them to the appropriate taxing authority; provided, however, that you promptly secure and deliver an official receipt for those withholdings and other documents we reasonably request to claim a foreign tax credit or refund. You must ensure that any taxes withheld are minimized to the extent possible under applicable law.
